Since the Homepage is your storefront, the next phase is building the Product Experience. For a service like Nirvena, this means moving from "browsing" to "doing."
To match the Headspace or Calm level of utility, you should focus on these three pillars next:
1. The Interactive "Match" Quiz (The Hook)
Instead of a boring registration form, build the Conversational Onboarding.
Why: It reduces anxiety by giving the user a "prescription" of what they need.
The Flow: Ask 3–5 questions (e.g., "How's your sleep?", "What's your primary stressor?").
The Result: A personalized dashboard recommendation (e.g., "We recommend starting with our 5-minute Stress Relief course").
2. The Content Library (The Value)
You have the FloatingPlayer, but it needs a home.
Library View: Create a "Meditation Library" page where users can filter by duration (1 min, 5 min, 10 min) or by goal.
Session Detail Page: A minimalist page for a single audio track with a transcript, speaker bio, and "Why this works" scientific snippets.
Grounding Tools: Interactive mini-apps like a Breathing Bubble (a circle that expands/contracts to guide breath) or a Mood Journal.
3. The Booking & User Portal (The Business)
If Nirvena offers professional sessions, you need the infrastructure for trust:
Therapist Profile Pages: Deep-dive pages for the "Healers" with their schedule and video intros.
Booking System: Integration with Calendly or a custom scheduling state.
Secure Dashboard: A "My Journey" area where users see their upcoming sessions, completed meditations, and progress badges.
My Recommendation for the "Very Next Step":
Build the Breathing Exercise Component or the Onboarding Quiz.
The Breathing Exercise is a "magic moment" for users—it's a free, instant bit of value they can use without even signing up. It’s also a great way to use Framer Motion to make your UI feel truly "alive."
